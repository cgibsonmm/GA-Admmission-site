                  After spending my childhood living in on the East Coast of Florida, I moved to Upstate New York to pursue a degree in film. In high school, T.V. Production, playing guitar and surfing consumed most of my life, I spent most high
                  school days hiding behind an old Casablanca video editing system. Then after school, I would head to the Cocoa Beach Pier and surf until dark or later. After graduation and moving to New York, I became consumed by work. A short time
                  after, my visions of a career in the film industry turned to become a vision of a professional FireFighter and Paramedic. I joined my local volunteer fire department and started taking any class I could get my hands on. In less than
                  a handful of months, my life went from shooting videos and surfing to working 12 plus hours a day on an ambulance and a lieutenant at The Hurleyville Fire Dept. <br /><a id="read-more-btn" class="btn modal-trigger lime accent-2"

      <p class="flow-text">Hello, I'm Corey Gibson.
        After spending my childhood living in on the East Coast of Florida, I moved to Upstate New York to pursue a degree in film. In high school, T.V. Production, playing guitar and surfing consumed most of my life, I spent most high school days
        hiding behind an old Casablanca video editing system. Then after school, I would head to the Cocoa Beach Pier and surf until dark or later. After graduation and moving to New York, I became consumed by work. A short time after, my visions of
        a career in the film industry turned to become a vision of a professional FireFighter and Paramedic. I joined my local volunteer fire department and started taking any class I could get my hands on. In less than a handful of months, my life
        went from shooting videos and surfing to working 12 plus hours a day on an ambulance and a lieutenant at The Hurleyville Fire Dept.
      </p>
      <p class="flow-text">
        Skip forward a year or two and while working on an ambulance with a partner that was a self-proclaimed "hacker," I started to take an interest in programming and to learn a more in-depth knowledge of computers. Circa 2009 I built my first
        word-press website it was called EMS-NOW.com and had hopes of it becoming a Reddit style blog site where emergency workers and first responders would be able to share their personal stories and experiences while on "the job." At the time, I
        used Wordpress tools to create this site, but with my lack of real knowledge and the cost of different hosting tools, the website did not last for more than a few months. While I built this first site and it failed miserably, still I was
        fascinated with the idea of creating different websites, and the knowable programming could offer. </p>
      <p class="flow-text">
        Once again, I put my dreams to the wayside when I took a full-time position in 2014 as an EMT for FDNY and moved to Brooklyn with the hope of shortly after that being able to be promoted to Fire Fighter. Since then, I have been working
        overnights on an ambulance in Williamsburg. This work is hard tiring and trying and offers little room for advancement. About three years ago I tried my hand at building a dating website for the local community in Sullivan County New York,
        which is still live today at <a href="www.sullivandates.com">sullivandates</a> and was built using techniques learned in The Ruby On Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl. While I found this book to be insightful after reading and re-reading I felt
        as though I did not have the skills needed to build a full site and the site still sits in the state of a "coming soon" landing page. Since then, I have been using different resources online to learn in and out pieces of Website development
        and software design. From Codecadamy, Team Treehouse, and Launch School.
      </p>
      <p class="flow-text">
        Today is
        <ins id="date"></ins>
        and I am 29 years old living in Queens with my girlfriend, my dog, and a cat. Over the past few years, we have had the opportunity to travel often. I have driven The Pacific Coast Highway, witnessed Old Faithful, visited The Louver, and
        attend Oktoberfest in Munich. In total, I believe I have been to 22 different country's and. I am also an avid backpacker and camper, and a PADI certified Scuba diver and have dove all over the Caribbean.
